        <h2>My Assessment</h2>
        <!--Hi Thomas!-->
        <p>
          <img
            alt="Most Interesting Man in the world"
            src="../pre-assessment/assets/img/content-image2.jpg"
          />
          most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is
          not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the
          message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is
          about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a
          necessarily large amount of data.
        </p>
        <p>
          This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization
          and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized"
          chunks of data, as simplification usually does.
        </p>
        <p class="alert">
          Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a
          time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once.
          Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information
          rather than the illumination of it.

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>
          Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the
          information properly using HTML
        </p>
        <h4>
          Explain the difference between the "alt" attribute and the "title"
          attribute.
        </h4>
        <p>
          the alt attribute provides alternative text for an image that's helps
          with accessability and screen readers. the title attribute provides
          additional information or tool tips for an element.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from
          the dictionary
        </h4>
        <dl>
          <dt>Term</dt>
          <dd>Definition</dd>
          <dt>Term</dt>
          <dd>Definition</dd>
          <dd>Definition</dd>
        </dl>

        <h4>
          Provide an example of link pointing to your favorite site &amp; create
          a style rule to change the background color of the link when the user
          hovers over it.
        </h4>
